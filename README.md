Trying to get better with my Cyber Security and Networking skills. Practicing HTML, CSS, BootStrap, Javascript, jQuery, PHP, MySQL, and PHPMyAdmin. I have grasped the basics of C, C++, Java, Python. Currently discovering them more in-depth and exploring additional languages. I also use Canva for my day to day Graphics Design jobs.
